# Can Presidential 'Executive Order' Volume Be Predicted?

Building a pipeline and predictive model of executive order counts based on economic and political indicators.

## Data Sources

Executive order data is retrieved from the Federal Register[^2].
Economic indicator data is retreived from the U.S. Census Bureau[^3].
Presidential job approval data is retreived from UC Santa Barbara[^4].

## Acknowledgments

This work was heavily influenced by a letter[^1] published in the American Political Science Review in 2019 and, in the future, I hope to expand my work to include the indicators and methods outlined by Drs. Dino P. Christensen and Douglas L. Kriner.
